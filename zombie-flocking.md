# Zombie Flocking Simulation

A two week long web based computer graphics project where we wanted to simulate a zombie horde's flocking behavior. We modeled the zombies' flocking theory after existing flocking theories in flocks of Swallows and then adjusted according to our collective ideas of how zombies would behave, since they aren't real... Right...?
